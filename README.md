# UI Pattern

I'm a travel, geography, and map enthusiast 🌏 

Inspired by a postcard I found from an old friend studying in 🇬🇧 London, I styled my project to emulate just that.

Utilzing data from an API, each stamp on the envelope will reveal a country. When you click a stamp, it pulls specific facts about the country in the form of a handwritten note. 

BONUS: if you know where the "address" is from - let's connect!

# Run

This project is deployed via Github Pages. Click this [Pages link](https://sydney-rd.github.io/ui-pattern/) and click each stamp for a few facts about some of the countries that I find interesting.
